# React Window Size Tracker

This project demonstrates the use of a custom React hook (`useDimensions`) to dynamically track and display the browser window size. It's built with React and utilizes Vite for a fast and efficient development environment.

## Introduction

This project showcases the creation and usage of a custom React hook to track the dimensions of the browser window. It's a practical example of how hooks can be used to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic in React applications.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of React.js
- Node.js and npm installed on your system

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
```

git clone 

```
1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies.
```

cd react-window-size-tracker
npm install

```
3. **Run the Application**: Start the development server.
```

npm run dev

````
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure
- **src/App.jsx**: The main application component that uses the `useDimensions` hook to display the window size.
- **src/hooks/useDimensions.js**: The custom hook that tracks the window size.

## Custom Hook: `useDimensions`
This custom hook, `useDimensions`, is designed to track the dimensions of the browser window. It returns an object containing the current width and height of the window.

#### Usage
To use this hook in a component, simply import it and call it within the component. The hook will automatically update the dimensions when the window size changes.

```jsx
import useDimensions from "./hooks/useDimensions";

function App() {
const dimensions = useDimensions();
return (
 <div>
   <h1>Window Size</h1>
   <p>Width: {dimensions.width}</p>
   <p>Height: {dimensions.height}</p>
 </div>
);
}
